# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown?
Coding language used on the GitHub platform. Similar to HTML but doesn't have as much capability. It is primarily used for documentation. 

## Examples and Syntax Guide

### Headings
Use #-###### for headings, make sure you include a space after the last # symbol. 
**Reminder**: Use just one h1 heading per page. 

### Italics and Bold
Italics can be done two ways. Here is *italics* and here is _italics_ as well.
Bold can also be done two ways. Here is **bold** and here is __bold__ as well.

Choose one of these styles for each, and stay consistent within your project. 

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists
There are three ways to do ordered lists. You can use these three ways:
* List item 1
* List item 2

- List item 1
- List item 2

* List item 1
* List item 2

#### Ordered Lists
There is one specific way to create ordered lists:
1. List item 1
1. List item 2
1. List item 3

### Images
We can also insert and display images using the following code:
![Image Name](URL to image)
![CodeFellowsLogo](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*MghnV-Q6kiAeO-ZQQreitA.png)

### Links
We can insert links as well. Using the following code:
[Text to appear](URl to link)
For example, here's a great guide for [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Quotes
We can include quotes like this one by Eleanor Roosevelt:
> Do one thing every day that scares you.

### Inline Code
We can include code text in our documents as well. We might need a '<p>' element here.
