## Structure Overview
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses elements to describe the structure of the page.
- Each element has an opening and closing tag. Opening tag denotes start of the content, closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes. An attribute provides additional information about the contents of an element. 
- Attributes require a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. The specified value should be placed in quotes. 

## HTML5 Layout
- Building blocks: block-level (starts on a new line) or inline (flow in between surrounding text)
- Containing elements: A box may be nested inside other block level elements, containing element is always the direct parent of that element.
